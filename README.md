# AntBOT

## Abstract:
AntBOT focusses on the implementation of an array of topics ranging from image processing to technicalities of mechanics – the pickup and place mechanism. Path planning plays an important role to ensure that the assigned task is completed within the minimum time. 
The project is basically to understand the cooperation and coordination in the work performed by the ants, aiming to make a BOT which will depict the work of a single ant. The BOT will collect leaves, honey, wood from the Shrubs Area and store it for winter and/or remove the trash from its Ant Hills. The BOT will follow a pre-defined black path (same as path left by ants while traveling to collect supplies so that their fellow ants can follow it).
This type of project can be implemented in a real-life scenario in manufacturing units. A lot of industries have an array of products produced at the place and stored at different locations (similar to anthills). Each location then requires some kind of service, which can be done in the minimum time using this theme’s solution.
